# React App 

This app is made while learning React from Namaste React website.

*I focused on React only, styling(CSS) may not look good*


- Used JSX to generate page markup.
- Used `Funcitonal Component` to work with JSX.
- Used curly-brace to add inline CSS into markup.
- Used `props` to render data dynamically.
- Used `Hooks` - (Hooks are just normal JS functions)
- Used `react-router-dom` to follow Single Page Applicatioin (SPA) paradigm. There are two types of routing:- Client side routing and Server side routing.
